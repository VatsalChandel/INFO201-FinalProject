## Safety

In this visualization, we wanted to create a graph that compares the most popular caffinated drinks in the market. We did this using the variables such as the ration of volume to caffine for the y coordinate, and the price of the drink itself for the x coordinate. The Slider allows for the user to select multiple drinks to compare them with one another. In addition, once already selected, you can unselect the drinks of interest by clicking them inside of the box.
