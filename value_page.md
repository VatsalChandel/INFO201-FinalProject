## Value

In this visualization, we wanted to create a graph that compares some of the most popular caffeinated drink products on the market based on volume to price ratio. Products with a higher bar have a greater volume of liquid in ml per dollar spent, and thus have a higher volume value than products with a lower bar. It is worth noting this chart does not take into consideration caffeine content, only drink volume.
