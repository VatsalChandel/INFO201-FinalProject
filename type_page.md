## Type

With this visualization, we wanted to determine how different types of drinks and brands compare in terms of caffeine and calorie contents. This chart separates caffeinated drinks by type, showing the proportion between the milligrams of caffeine and calories in the drink. Each product is sorted by brand, with stacked bars indicating brands with multiple products of that type. Within each drink type, brands with higher bar values indicate these brands have a higher caffeine content per calorie in their drinks.
