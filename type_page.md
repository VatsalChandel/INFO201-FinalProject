## Type of Drinks & Brands


- This chart intends to understand how individual drinks can impact the health of consumers based on the proportion between the milligrams of caffeine and calories in the drink. By choosing this proportion, consumers can make informed decisions about how strong these drinks are, along with which brands produce these drinks.

- Another reason why we chose to use calories as a divisor was to show if the drink will also provide sustenance and nourishment relative to the amount of caffeine in it. Consumers can also make better dieting choices and see if there is a more efficient way to get their desired amount of caffeine without consuming excess calories (For that, they would likely want to chose a drink like Biohazard Coffee, who has a Caffeine to Calorie Ratio of about 309 mg of caffeine per calorie).

- In this specific page, we wanted to answer how the different types of drinks differ in caffeine and calorie content. For consumers, we wanted to answer questions like:

      - How do the different types of drinks compare in caffeine content?
      - Which drinks in each of these types have the right amount of caffeine and calories for me?
      - Which brands produce which types of drinks, and how much caffeine and calories are in their drinks?
