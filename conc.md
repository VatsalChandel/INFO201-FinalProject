(from safety page, maybe use in conclusion) From the graph we can see that multiple coffee products contain more caffeine than is safe to be consumed in one day, including Black Label Brewed Coffee, Biohazard Coffee, and Stipe Miocic Extra Strength Coffee. Although many non-coffee caffeinated drinks contain less caffeine than the daily safe maximum, some contain a very small volume of liquid. Consumers should consider how much of a caffeinated drink they intend to consume during a day when selecting a product to purchase.
