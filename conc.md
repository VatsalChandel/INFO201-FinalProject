# Analysis
## Safety
From the graph of safety page, users can see that multiple coffee products contain more caffeine than is safe to be consumed in one day, including Black Label Brewed Coffee, Biohazard Coffee, and Stipe Miocic Extra Strength Coffee. Although many non-coffee caffeinated drinks contain less caffeine than the daily safe maximum, some contain a very small volume of liquid. Consumers should consider how much of a caffeinated drink they intend to consume during a day when selecting a product to purchase.
- The vary amount of different drinks' volume would provide different amount caffeine. Also, there are so many types of drinks can provide caffeine to people every day.
- In __Safety__ page, we wanted to answer how the different types of drinks differ in caffeine and calorie content. For consumers, we wanted to answer questions like:
        - What specific brand of drink contains more than 400 mg cafeeine?
        - What is the volume of the drinks?
        - What os the caffeine content of the drinks?

## Type
By choosing this proportion, consumers can make informed decisions about how strong these drinks are, along with which brands produce these drinks.
- Another reason why we chose to use calories as a divisor was to show if the drink will also provide sustenance and nourishment relative to the amount of caffeine in it. Consumers can also make better dieting choices and see if there is a more efficient way to get their desired amount of caffeine without consuming excess calories (For that, they would likely want to chose a drink like Biohazard Coffee, who has a Caffeine to Calorie Ratio of about 309 mg of caffeine per calorie).

- In __Type__ page, we wanted to answer how the different types of drinks differ in caffeine and calorie content. For consumers, we wanted to answer questions like:
      - How do the different types of drinks compare in caffeine content?
      - Which drinks in each of these types have the right amount of caffeine and calories for me?
      - Which brands produce which types of drinks, and how much caffeine and calories are in their drinks?

# Conclusion
Caffeine is regarded as the stimulating ingredient, and coffee itself is one of the most popular beverage in our daily lives. However, not only coffee contains caffeine, but also other drinks we listed in the graph contain caffeine. The excess caffeine would put people's health at risk.

Some brands of coffee contains much more caffeine than is safe to be consumer in one day. The healthy adults can take around 400 mg caffeine per day, but some coffee can provide even more than 1000 mg caffeine per serve. When we regard these drinks as our daily beverage, they are actually endanger our health.

This means we lack policy to regulate the caffeine drinks. Even though majority of caffeine content drinks are in the safe range, there should be clear label on each drink to line out the caffine content. Some restaurants would line out the estimated calorie on the menu, so some coffee shop or cafe can also label out the caffeine contents of drinks.
