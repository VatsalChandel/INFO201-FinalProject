## Introduction

For this project, we seek to inform consumers of caffeinated drinks on the products available to them based on three areas of focus: Type, Value, and Safety.

Firstly, we will divide up the caffeine products available into different type groupings. These are Coffee, Energy Drinks, Energy Shots, Soft Drinks, Tea, and Water. Within these type groups, we will assess the different caffeine and calorie contents of individual drinks from various brands. From this information, a consumer can be informed on what type of drink they should buy based on trends in caffeine and calorie content within drink types, as well as being informed on which brands and which specific products best fit their preferences.

Next, we will perform a value assessment on some of the most popular caffeinated drinks to determine relative volume to price and caffeine to price ratios. From this information, consumers who are value-minded can be informed on which popular caffeinated products provide the most drink and caffeine content for their money.

Finally, we will perform a safety assessment of various caffeinated drinks to determine how they compare to health official recommendations on caffeine and calorie intake by volume. From this information, a consumer can be informed on which caffeinated products are the safest to be consumed in their preferred style, or whether the products they already drink are safe or not in terms of daily caffeine and calorie intake.


## The Dataset

To answer these questions, we will be utilizing data from *Caffeine Informer* on the caffeine and calorie contents of most caffeinated drink brands and types. Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heitornunes/caffeine-content-of-drinks

This dataset was collected manually by contacting manufacturers, consulting medical journals, and studying company websites. *Caffeine Informer* collected the data to provide a singular source of information on caffeinated drinks. Brands are often not required by law to test their products and present drink contents in an easily accessible manner, so this dataset serves to address this issue.

Some questions we considered when working with the dataset were to do with the validity of the information and the choice of variables included in the dataset. We cannot be sure that caffeinated drink companies are accurately reporting caffeine and calorie contents and must rely on their word or that of third-party testers. There exists the possibility that wealthy drink manufacturers hold influence over those who created the dataset and have they data included be skewed to improve the perception of their products.

Within the dataset itself, there are a number of limitations which must be considered. For each individual caffeinated drink product, no brand information is listed so these connections must be made by ourselves. Many of the product name listings are difficult to associate with a certain brand and can be misleading due to over-saturation of the space. There is also no indication within the data of the type of caffeine used in each product, meaning these sources of caffeine could contain different chemical compositions, presenting different effects and health concerns for consumers. The source of calories in each drink is also not specified, furthering the difficulty in making precise assessments on contents and consumer health. An ideal dataset would also include all ingredients listed on the product nutrition label, which this dataset lacks.
