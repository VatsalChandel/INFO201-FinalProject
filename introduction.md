# Introduction 

- Caffeine is a big part in individual’s lives. Whether it comes from coffee, tea, or energy drinks, people love to consume it. And because there are so many ways for an individual to consume caffeine, we are curious to see different statistics about brands, types of caffeinated drinks, and the overall caffeine content in them.
- Here are the questions that we aim to answer:
  - What types of drinks have the most caffeine?
  - Which brands contain the most caffeine?
    - In what type of drink? 
  - Which brands contain the least caffeine?
    - In what type of drink?
  - What is the average caffeine amount per milligram across different brands?
    - Across different types of drinks?
  - What is the average caffeine amount per calorie across different brands?
    - Across different types of drinks?
  - What is the average colorie amount per volume across different brands? 
    - Across different types of drinks? 
    
- Understanding the difference in caffeine content in the different drinks could be important for those who are trying to get away from caffeine. Caffeine addiction can be a huge problem for individuals because it can lead to worse sleep quality, an increased heart rate, anxiety and fatigue. Being able to find substitutes could greatly benefit those who need it. Also by looking at this dataset, we will be able to look at what brands put the most calories in their drinks. Having an answer to this could also benefit those who are trying to cut down on their calorie intake.

# Data

Where did you find the data? Please include a link to the data source 

- We found our dataset on a website called Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heitornunes/caffeine-content-of-drinks 

Who collected the data?  

- The Caffeine Informer collected this data. 

How was the data collected or generated?

- They (The Caffeine Informer) collected the data by hand, through calling manufacturers, scanning medical journals, and by looking through company websites. 

Why was the data collected?

- Data in this field is scarce and difficult to find. Stores and boutique brands are not required by law to test their products, so data in this field could significantly help consumers make educated decisions. 


How many observations (rows) are in your data?  

- 610

How many features (columns) are in the data?  

- 5

What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?  

- Are companies properly reporting these amounts of caffeine? Do the manufacturers have any undue influence on the people who created this dataset?What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)

What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)

- There are many limitations with this dataset due to its lack of features and its lack of brand name indication. One of the major issues with this dataset is the limited information available about the items in this dataset. This dataset only provides the drink’s name, caffeine content, volume, amount of calories, and drink type. There also is no category for the brand of the observations, meaning that we will have to take the time to categorize all of these drinks manually. Many of the drink names are difficult to associate with a certain brand and can often be misleading if someone is not familiar with the drink. There is no indicator for what brand is selling a drink in the dataset, meaning that parties using the data would have to assume that the brand is in the name, or look for the brand on their own. Additionally, the type of caffeine is not specified, meaning that these sources of caffeine could have different chemical compositions and different effects on consumers. The source of calories is also not specified, which could make it difficult for us to draw any valid conclusions in relation to the drink and its contents. A more detailed dataset would ideally have most of the ingredients from the nutrition label on the back listed, in order to gain a better understanding of the ingredients. The dataset also lacks a quantifier for how much caffeine is in each milliliter of the drinks.
