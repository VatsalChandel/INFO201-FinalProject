## Saftey!


- The goal of this chart is to help communicate to readers how different drinks differ in caffeine and volume. We hope that this will help individuals make better choices when it comes to caffeine consumption by helping them achieve similar goals in a healthier and safer way.

- This chart aims to answer a couple of questions, specifically:
  - What types of drinks have the most Caffeine? What types have the least? 
  - Which brands contain the most Caffeine? Which contain the least?
  
  
- To answer the first part of the first question, when all of the categories and the whole volume range are selected, we can see that the drink in this data set that contains the most amount of caffeine is Black Label Brewed Coffee. It contains 1555 mg of caffeine, has 0 calories, and has a volume of 354.882 ml.
- For the second part, we found that the drinks varried from Energy Drinks, to Soft Drinks, to Tea, and Water. They all contained 0 mg of Caffeine ,however, the Soft Drinks tend to have more calories whilst Water had the least. 

- To answer the first part of the second question, we saw that the top 5 strongest brands were Devil Mountain Coffee Company, Very Strong Coffee, Devils Brew Coffee, Taft Coffee, and High Voltage Coffee in that order. This made sense to us because all of these were considered coffees. 
- For the second part, we found that the 5 weakest brands were Herbal Teas, Arizona's Mucho Mango, Schweppes Tonic Water, Perrier Sparkling Water, and A&W Diet Cream Soda. This made sense to us because most of these are water based teas which contain little to no caffeine.
