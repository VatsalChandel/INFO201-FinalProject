# Introduction

For this project, we seek to inform consumers of caffeinated drinks on the products available to them based on three areas of focus: Type, Value, and Safety.

Firstly, we will divide up the caffeine products available into different type groupings. These are Coffee, Energy Drinks, Energy Shots, Soft Drinks, Tea, and Water. Within these type groups, we will assess the different caffeine and calorie contents of individual drinks from various brands. From this information, a consumer can be informed on what type of drink they should buy based on trends in caffeine and calorie content within drink types, as well as being informed on which brands and which specific products best fit their preferences.

Next, we will perform a value assessment on some of the most popular caffeinated drinks to determine relative volume to price and caffeine to price ratios. From this information, consumers who are value-minded can be informed on which popular caffeinated products provide the most drink and caffeine content for their money.

Finally, we will perform a safety assessment of various caffeinated drinks to determine how they compare to health official recommendations on caffeine and calorie intake by volume. From this information, a consumer can be informed on which caffeinated products are the safest to be consumed in their preferred style, or whether the products they already drink are safe or not in terms of daily caffeine and calorie intake.


To answer these questions, we will be utilizing data from *Caffeine Informer* on the caffeine and calorie contents of most caffeinated drink brands and types. Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heitornunes/caffeine-content-of-drinks

This dataset was collected manually by contacting manufacturers, consulting medical journals, and studying company websites. *Caffeine Informer* collected the data to provide a singular source of information on caffeinated drinks. Brands are often not required by law to test their products and present drink contents in an easily accessible manner, so this dataset serves to address this issue.

Some questions we considered when working with the dataset were to do with the validity of the information and the choice of variables included in the dataset. We cannot be sure that caffeinated drink companies are accurately reporting caffeine and calorie contents and must rely on their word or that of third-party testers. There exists the possibility that wealthy drink manufacturers hold influence over those who created the dataset and have they data included be skewed to improve the perception of their products.

Within the dataset itself, there are a number of limitations which must be considered. For each individual caffeinated drink product, no brand information is listed so these connections must be made by ourselves. Many of the product name listings are difficult to associate with a certain brand and can be misleading due to over-saturation of the space. There is also no indication within the data of the type of caffeine used in each product, meaning these sources of caffeine could contain different chemical compositions, presenting different effects and health concerns for consumers. The source of calories in each drink is also not specified, furthering the difficulty in making precise assessments on contents and consumer health. An ideal dataset would also include all ingredients listed on the product nutrition label, which this dataset lacks.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

From this project we were able to judge a variety of caffeinated drinks based on three primary criterion in order to better inform a consumer on which product would best suit their preferences.

From the Type consideration we were able to organize caffeinated drinks by type and brand to determine how each compares in terms of caffeine content per calorie. From this chart we were able to determine that some caffeinated drink types such as Energy Drinks are relatively homogeneous in terms of caffeine content per calorie whereas Soft Drinks contain more variability. From this, a consumer could determine which type of caffeinated drink best suits their preferences in terms of caffeine and calorie content, and from there could specify the specific brand and type of drink they would prefer. In this way, a consumer is able to narrow down there choices within the wide variety of caffeinated drinks available to make their decision easier.

From the Value consideration we demonstrated how some of the most popular caffeinated drink products compare in terms of price to volume. From this chart we can see that products like Arizona Iced Tea and Mountain Dew have an extremely good volume to price value ratio, whereas products like 5 Hour Energy and Starbucks Bottled Cold Brew have a much worse value. This information allows the money-minded consumer to determine which caffeinated drink will be the greatest value for them in terms of the volume in liquid received for their purchase. This information can help customers gain a better understanding of which products may be overpriced based on brand name recognition and highlight more valuable products they may not have previously considered.

From the Safety consideration we determined that some caffeinated drinks contain more caffeine than is safe to be consumed within a single day. These products include Black Label Brewed Coffee, Biohazard Coffee, and Stipe Miocic Extra Strength Coffee. Although many non-coffee caffeinated drinks contain less caffeine than the daily safe maximum, some contain a very small volume of liquid. Consumers should consider how much of a caffeinated drink they intend to consume during a day when selecting a product to purchase. From this chart, a consumer can be informed on whether a drink falls within the safe guidelines for caffeine consumption, and can ascertain an idea of how many drinks they could have during a day to stay within safe caffeine consumption limits.

With this information, a consumer can be the best informed on the caffeinated drinks available to them and which suits their preferences in terms of Type, Value, and Safety, in order to make an informed purchase.
